# BIOS 6624 – Advanced Statistical Methods and Analysis

This repository contains coursework for **BIOS 6624: Advanced Statistical Methods and Analysis**, Spring 2026, at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.

The goal of this repository is to maintain a **clear, organized, and reproducible analysis workflow** using Git and GitHub, following best practices introduced in the course.

---

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into five project folders, corresponding to Projects 0–4 for the course.


Each project folder will contain all materials related to that project only.

---

## Project Folder Organization

Each `Project_*` directory may include the following subfolders:

- `Background/`  
  Background information, problem descriptions, or relevant references.

- `Code/`  
  R scripts used to clean data, perform analyses, and generate results.

- `DataRaw/`  
  Raw data provided by the instructor or collaborators (not tracked on GitHub).

- `DataProcessed/`  
  Processed or intermediate data generated from raw data (not tracked on GitHub).

- `Reports/`  
  Final reports, markdown files, and other output documents.

Not all projects will necessarily use every subfolder.

---

## Reproducibility Notes

- All analyses are conducted using **R**.
- Code is written to allow another analyst to reproduce results from the provided scripts.
- Large data files and intermediate outputs are excluded using `.gitignore`.
- Git commits are made frequently to document analysis progress.

---

## What Is *Not* Included

- Lecture slides, notes, or other non-project class materials  
- Raw or processed data files unless explicitly required  
- Automatically generated output that can be reproduced by running the code
